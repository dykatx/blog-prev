# 🌩️ Dykat — Cloud Security Architect Portfolio

## ✨ Overview

This is my personal portfolio website where I document my learning path in cybersecurity, cloud security, and systems programming. The site now uses an "Abyssal Plum / Violet" palette for a moody, modern look with refined contrast and readable UI.

## 🎯 Purpose

- **Portfolio**: Showcase my skills, projects, and learning focus areas
- **Daily Logs**: Document my learning progress and insights
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Share technical experiences and travel reflections
- **Professional Presence**: Establish a digital identity in the cybersecurity space

## 🚀 Features

### Design & UX
- **Abyssal Plum Palette**: Dark, moody layout using Abyssal Plum / Nocturne Violet as the foundation with Royal Hemlock Purple and Gothic Rose Quartz accents.
- **Refined Motion**: Subtle, purposeful animation for clarity and rhythm (fade, lift, focus states)
- **Responsive Design**: Fully mobile-optimized with breakpoints for tablets and phones
- **Solid Surfaces**: Dark, grounded surface panels for better contrast and a serious tone
- **Subtle Texture**: Minimal texture and depth (no noisy overlays) for readability

### Technical Features
- **Pure HTML/CSS/JS**: No frameworks, lightweight and fast
- **Custom Fonts**: Playfair Display for headers, Space Grotesk for body text
- **Search Functionality**: Real-time filtering in daily logs
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Native smooth scroll with offset for fixed navigation
- **Hide-on-Scroll Nav**: Navigation hides when scrolling down, appears when scrolling up
- **SVG Noise Overlay**: Subtle texture effect across the entire site

### Content Sections
1. **Home Page** (`index.html`)
   - Hero section with animated profile
   - About Me introduction
   - Current Focus (4 skill cards)
   - Contact information

2. **Daily Logs** (`daily-logs.html`)
   - Chronological learning entries
   - Search/filter functionality
   - Month dividers
   - Topics, hours, and tags for each entry

3. **Blog Posts** (e.g., `trip.html`)
   - Long-form content
   - Travel reflections
   - Architecture comparisons
